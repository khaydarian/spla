# TODO

* pm: Organize TODO items better than this list.
* pm: Survey blog posts for forgotten TODO items.
* pm: Start a website?
* blog: Write export-to-website tool (or find static site generator).
* blog: Add photos and scope images.
* blog: Clean up README.md.
* design: Document part selection rationale.
* reference: Retrieve datasheets for all parts.
* reference: Reverify datasheets for gotcha details.
* schematic: Simulate opamp layouts in analog block.
* schematic: Add weak pulldown for PPU-2 reset line.
* schematic: Add 1-ohm resistors in series with power rails, with test points for power measurement.
* schematic: Add FPGA decoupling capacitors.
* schematic: Review with Nate.
* schematic: Run through [schematic checklist](https://github.com/azonenberg/pcb-checklist/blob/master/schematic-checklist.md)
* schematic/pcb: Change JTAG header to something vaguely standard (10-pin?) with 1.27mm pinheaer.
* schematic/pcb: Hook up extra three pins on FPGA to something (LEDs?).
* pcb: Rework traces inside FTDI chip (since changing from EP footprint).
* pcb: Shield VRAM data bus from power switching noise, if necessary?
* pcb: Add traceability markings (logo, name, revision, date, space for serial ID sticker).
* pcb: Run through [PCB checklist](https://github.com/azonenberg/pcb-checklist/blob/master/layout-checklist.md)
* lab: Verify PPU and VRAM footprint measurements.
* lab: Bodge wire to vblank / hblank, and measure analog voltage levels with scope.
* rtl: Install "Project Trellis" tools and build example.
* rtl: Build async fifo.
* rtl: Build plausible FTDI-fifo interface.
* rtl: Build stream merging protocol.
* rtl: Build opcode processor.
* rtl: Build bringup LED-flasher.
* rtl: Build bringup boundary-scan-like image? Possibly get a Lattice tool instead.
* software: Set up CLI tool framework.
* inventory: Write summary tool.
* inventory: Add borrowed scope.
* inventory: Note pre-existing tools (#1 screwdriver).
* inventory: Order chips I'll definitely need, to verify footprints against PCB layout.
