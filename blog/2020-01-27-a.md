Chatted with Kor and Chris F. about things.

*   I should get an ICE40 development board, just to figure out the toolchains
    and such.  A good reference to building on an ICE40 FPGA:
    https://github.com/nesl/ice40_examples

*   Analog output probably isn't too big a deal; ADC chips aren't that hard.

*   I'll likely have to rev the board a bunch, because this isn't so well
    figured out.  That's probably fine.

*   FPGAs often have enough internal RAM that I can hold a whole frame (maybe,
    depends on bit-depth).  Even then, pushing the data out through an FTDI
    chip in 8-bit synchronous mode is very plausible.

*   Bringup might be tricky, because I'm not entirely sure how the PPU chips
    operate.  I might need to tap pins on a real SNES to figure out how it
    works for real.

*   I might need to have the CPU included as well; the HDMA hardware might be
    in the CPU instead.  I need to figure out SNES programming more to be sure.

For now, getting an ICE40 FPGA to play with is a good idea.  Chris F. suggests
the ICE40HX8K-B-EVN, so I bought one of those.
