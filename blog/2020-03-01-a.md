Incidentally, I figured out the models numbers -- apparently Nintendo gave
separate numbers to each of the different products, so:

*   `SNS-001`: the Super Nintendo itself,
*   `SNS-002`: the corresponding power adapter,
*   `SNS-006`: Super Mario World cartrigde, a launch title,

Probably others are similar.
