Finally returning to this project, after work cooled down a bit.

First step is to replace the FPGA on `b002` with the extra I have.  I'm going to try out my new preheating plate while I'm at it.

The plastic on the pin headers is PBT, and datasheet says it can handle 245C for 3-5 seconds; max 105C for normal operation.  Since all the leaded solder melts at 183C, I'll have to leave it low anyway -- about 150C I think.  This is probably fine, but I'll have to protect the `J4` jumpers from melting anyhow (like they did on the first board).

In-the-moment notes:
* preheater 155C (bit high?)
* hot air 400C
* tiny dab of flux, while hot, melts immediately
* J4 got a little scorced, but not badly -- need two layers of kapton tape
* preheating plate takes a long time to heat and cool; probably best for doing several things in sequence
* Marked bad FPGA with "X" label, but retained the chip for practice.

Testing:
* `bringup_ftdi` shows a bridge between MOSI/MISO, which is weird because programming the FPGA still works.
* `bringup_fpga` flashes `D7`/`D8` as expected.
* `bringup_fifo` shows strange behavior: `FIFO_D0` is bridged with `D7`, and `D8` doesn't always flash when it should.  This isn't consistent, so it doesn't look like a bad connection:

```
$ make && ./splat --device board bringup_fifo
make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.

D0 isn't obviously shorted, but also is unusably broken.  Might try reflowing the chip again, but there's no guarantee this will work.
