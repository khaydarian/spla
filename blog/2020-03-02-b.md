While the SNES chips are sensibly arranged, the VRAM chips are ... not. I'm not
completely convinced that I have the right package, but the pin order is
probably the same:

*   West side (1-14, top to bottom)
    *   Address 14, 12, 7 - 0
    *   Data 0 - 2
    *   Ground
*   East side (15-28, bottom to top)
    *   Data 3 - 7
    *   Ground
    *   Address 10
    *   Output Enable (Active-low)
    *   Address 11, 9, 8, 13
    *   Write Enable (Active-low)
    *   VCC

This is slightly bonkers, but I can workaround it by doing most of the swap
silliness around the VRAM chips, and leaving clean buses elsewhere.

One thing I'm not sure about is how far I can push the signals before it's a
problem.  At the very least, since both PPU chips are running on the same
clock, I'll probably want to keep the traces approximately the same length.  At
these rates it probably doesn't matter, though.  I'll want to verify with the
actual SNES hardware layout (once I can get the thing open!)

But, I'm pretty sure I have a layout that works(ish).
