Host USB doesn't recognize the FTDI chip.  Current theories:

* Chip isn't signaling correctly.
* `D+`/`D-` pins aren't soldered down correclty.
* Traces are borked.
* Soldering to usb connector is broken.
* Shield soldered to ground makes too much noise.
* `PHY` and/or `PLL` power inputs are too noisy / need inductors.
* Software problem on the (windows) host.
* `ID` pin on USB connector should be grounded (based on HX8K eval board).

First thing to try is to hack up a sacrificial USB cable so I can stick the scope on the data pins, and see if I can correlate any traffic with powering up the board.  But let's try with just the shield-divided cable, and see what happens.

This works.  WTF.  It must be that having the shield grounded screws something up; either too much ground-loop noise, or it throws off the host's device-recogniztion electronics.

Device shows up as:

* Vendor ID `0x0403` (FTDI)
* Product ID `0x6010`
* Revision `0700`
* Description "FTDI Dual RS232-HS"

This is exactly correct for a blank-eeprom device.  So, that problem's solved for now, but there's no good way to un-ground the shield, since it's the pins of the USB connector.  I'll have to use a hacked-up USB cable until I get the next board manufactured.

Ironically this is probably the smallest mistake I've made on the FTDI schematic; it's one pin way off to the side.  Dang.

USB frame shows up pretty well. [SDS00017]
