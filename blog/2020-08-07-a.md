No defines: 100ma / 1.2W / 30C
SCAN_READ: same
SCAN_WRITE: same
SCAN_BOTH:  same when *writing*, 180mA / 2.15W / 45C when *reading*

Something's wrong with the bidirectional IO driver setup.

Aha: I might have the pin direction backwards.  Looking at the techlib reference, I seems like I've read the truth table backwards.
