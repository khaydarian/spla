1.  SNES VRAM Bringup
    1.  Solder VRAM chips on the board.
    1.  Run `splat bringup_vram`.
        1.   One bit error with address `0x2000` on A chip, bit `VAA13`.
        1.   Signal looks ok on SRAM pin and pad, sometimes.
        1.   Forceful probing on the levelshifter pin makes this work -- just a cold solder joint?
        1.   Yep, fixed.
    1.  Run `splat bringup_vram --random`.  Pass.
