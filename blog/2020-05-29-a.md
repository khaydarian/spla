Bringup continues.  

Turns out the previous "weird flashing" problem was a brain failure on my part: the `bringup_ftdi` code initialized MPSSE mode on both the A and B interfaces, but the `load_bitstream` code only did so on A (because I'd forgotten it only applies to the active interface).  Oops.  Easily fixed, though.

I had to finagle about a bit with the MPSSE opcodes to get the right read/write mode, but it appears that I'm now able to talk to the ECP5 FPGA correctly, and I can get the correct device ID:

```bash
$ ./spla --debug fpga_load_bitstream ../rtl/build/bringup_blinky.bit
[W:8a861d00800000820000]
[W:8a861d0080084b8280b0]
[W:80484b8280b1]
[W:80084b8281b180004b]
[W:150300e0000000250300]
[R:41112043]
Read ID: 0x41112043
[W:80404b80484b]
```

Of course this doesn't actually load any bitstream yet, as I've got other bugs to work out -- but this proves that I can actually talk to the FPGA bidirectionally, and that's a strongly positive signal.

Next step is to interact with the FPGA in more detail, figure out how to load an entire bitstream, and set the device into user mode (ie, actually running the bitstream).  I'll also need to fix the weird performance problem I had earlier (which might be due to virtual machine USB passthrough mumble).
