Calamity!  Turns out that, despite measuring the the PPU pin pitch at *least* four times, I still got it wrong: the pins don't line up.  Seems like the PPU chips have 0.65mm pin pitch, rather thatn 0.635mm -- which makes sense, because Nintendo is Japanese and likely to prefer metric, where 0.635mm is 1/40th of an inch (25.4 / 40 == 0.635).  Obvious, in retrospect.

Also, I printed out the PCB on paper to check the component footprints, and everything checked out -- but for some reason I didn't desolder the PPU chips to check them, even though they're by far the most likely footprint to get wrong.

So I need to fix the board layout and get new ones manufactured.  Argh!  At least I can fix a bunch of other minor issues (like grounding the USB connector shield), and order a stencil.

ALso, while I'm at it, I'll probably end up swapping pins around, to move `J4` farther away from the FPGA (since I keep melting it), and moving the test points to an actual pin header somewhere near J3.  This introduces some complication, because I'll have a different `.lpf` constraint file for different boards.  Not sure how to deal with this yet.
