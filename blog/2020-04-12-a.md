Analog re-design is complete, and I have perhaps learned enough of analog
electronic to have designed something that *might* work. No idea if it'll
*actually* work, but there's a good chance, and I can adjust a bunch of the
passive filters (or bypass them entirely with moderate rework), that I can
probably finagle some reasonable output.  At the very least, there's nothing in
the current design that I know is wrong (yet).  Review pending; might change
this all entirely.

I've also rewritten the README to be a better overview of the project, so it's
easier for an outsider to see what's it's about, and added a PCB screenshot.
