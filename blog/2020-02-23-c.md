I think I've found a better power solution than copying the EPC5 eval board,
which uses two big $6 chips that JLCPCB-SMT doesn't carry. The `TPS54331DR` is
a cheap (~$.26) step-down DC converter, which takes 3.5V-28V input and
production adjustable output down to 0.8V. This *seems* like it would work
(although I need 4 of them to produce 5V/3.3V/2.5V/1.2V). The really attractive
thing about it, however, is that JLCPCB-SMT has them in their catalog, and has
a ton of them in stock (>13000) -- that implies that it's a pretty popular
part. Like any switching voltage regulator it needs a bunch of passives (6
capacitors, 5 resistors, 1 inductor, 1 shottkey diode), but a few less than the
eval board (7 capacitors, 5 resistors, 1 inductor, 2 diodes). I'd prefer a
physcially-smaller part, but it hardly matters for power, which doesn't have to
be close by. Let's try this for now.
