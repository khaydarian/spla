Power sequencing!  According to 3.2 "Recommended Operating Conditions", I need
three voltage supplies:

*   1.1V for VCC
*   2.5V for VCCAUX
*   Up to 3.3V for VCCIOx

I don't need the 1.2V source that the eval board has, because that's for the
SERDES which I don't have.  In that case, I can use the eval board's switching
linear regulator stuff, and adjust one of those to produce 5V -- if the chip
can support that.
