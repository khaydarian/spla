Tried reflowing b002 FPGA again -- now D0 is ok, but D3/D4 are bridged, and D5/D6 are bridged.  One more reflow.

No good; now D7 is also disconnected.  I'm out of FPGAs, so I'm stuck for now.

Actually, it's even worse:

```

```

All of those pins are wacky.  I think I've overheated the FPGA and broken it somehow, but this board is toast for now.
