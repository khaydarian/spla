A new wrinkle! The `R`/`G`/`B` pins on PPU2 are *analog*.  I've no clue what
the bit depth of that might be, and even then I'd need an awfully fast ADC to
sample it at full speed.  I can get >10MSample/s ADC chips, but probably can't
do it inside the FPGA alone -- and even then, it produces an order of magnitude
more data.  Either I need way better compression, or some other technique.
Given the constraints on how many colors acn be on the screen, it *might* be
possible to re-palletize the output image.

Also, analog pins weakly imply that the PPU chips might be using dynamic logic
-- it's possible to use a resistor-based DAC, but that's kinda expensive in
VLSI; I'm really guessing here.

Alternatively, since the PPU chips ought to output the same signal every NTSC
frame, we could sample the analog signal into a capacitor at a given pixel (dot
clock), and then run a slow ADC on it, filling in a handful of pixels per
frame.  This is ... not a great idea.  But, even ignoring the analog pins,
retrieving data from different time slices based on deterministic execution of
the PPU internals could work -- especially if we can't get data out of the
board fast enough, and can't store a full frame's worth (for which we still
don't have a complete estimate, actually.
