[An article on Ars
Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/how-snes-emulators-got-a-few-pixels-from-complete-perfection/)
came out today, linked from Hacker News, and there's a Discord channel for it:
https://discord.gg/Fx7TfKn .  Cool.

A helpful person there (@awygle) mentioned that the bidirectional level
shifters are not so great, and they're probably right.  Re-reading the
datasheet shows that it's really designed for open-drain applications, but
works for push-pull -- but perhaps not as I want; they're limited to ~20 MHz.
I really need the controlled-direction kind, in that case, which takes up even
more pins on the FPGA.
