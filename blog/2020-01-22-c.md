It'd be really nice to be able to socket the big PPU and VRAM chips, at least
-- solder those on is painful.  I know it's possible to get a QFP / TQFP
socket, but maybe not in the PPU chip's size.

Update: [1] indicates that you can definitely get a QFP socket for the CPU;
the PPU chips match that form factor.
