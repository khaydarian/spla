Adjusted some minor things in the schematic -- apparently global flags also
have a type (input / output / bidi / etc), which is handy since that wasn't
really obvious otherwise.

Turns out that the FT2232H is common enough that JLCPCB-SMT has it in stock.
Cool.  It might be better to have them do the front side of the board where the
LEDs and such are, and put all the big stuff on the back side. On the other hand,
soldering a handful of surface-mount LEDs isn't too bad; or I could use chunky
THT devices instead -- only because they're prettier.
