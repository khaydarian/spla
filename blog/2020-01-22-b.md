Turns out Lattice has [a whole bunch of TQFP-packaged
FPGAs](https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Solutions/Packaging/TQFP) with various
pinout combinations (44/48/64/100/128/144/176) -- that covers the range I
expect to need (>100, <150ish), but I'd really prefer to be able to use an
ICE40 or something that the open-source toolchains work for.  Getting stuck
with an icky proprietary toolchain would be unfortunate.

Still need to figure out some ballpark data throughput numbers, so I can tell
if I can ship data out fast enough via USB 2.0, or if I need USB 3.0, or if I
need to buffer in some big chunk of ram.  DRAM is probably too painful for me,
but there's other options maybe.
