ADC chips! No way there are in JLCPCB-SMT, so parametric searching on Digikey
for:

*   Analog to Digital Converters
*   8-10 bits wide
*   Sampling rate at least 20Msps
*   Analog input of 5V
*   Digital output of 3.3V
*   1 channel (2 is useless, since I'd need two dfferent parts)
*   In stock, or normally stocking
*   No DigiReels

This comes down to bascially three chips:

*   TI's `ADS931E` / `ADS930E`: 8-bit, 30Msps, $8.17 / ~$8.49
*   TI's `THS1030CPW`: 10-bit, 30Msps, $11.34
*   Analog's `AD9280ARSZ` (or `ADS9280ARSZRL`): 8-bit, 32Msps, $6.36

All of these are in a standard TSOP-28 package. Looks like the `AD9280ARSC` is
it. And it turns out KiCad even has a symbol for it already!  I'd be ok drawing
my own for this, but that's a nice win.

Curiously this is pretty similar to the `AD9200` I was looking at earlier --
that's 10-bit deep (which I now know I don't need, due to 5-bit color output),
but only 20Msps.

I also need to do some power budgeting -- a 5V brick can give me 2A easily, but
I'll need to take care with the LDOs. Plausibly I can have a couple extra 3.3V
LDOs, and separate the power domains (or just stick them in parallel, maybe).
Fortunately the FPGA is powered primarily by 1.1V and 2.5V, which nothing else
uses (it only uses a tiny amount for the 3.3V IO banks), and the unknown SNES
chips are on the 5V / 2A supply directly(ish).
