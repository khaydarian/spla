Thought on BGA soldering:  The datasheet for most of these parts has a solder
reflow diagram (in particular the FT2232HL, which I'm using as an example),
showing temperature limits over time.  Normally you'd do this with a
solder reflow oven, which has very precise temperature control like
this.  However, in principle it might be possible to use a thermocouple
thermometer and a heat gun to get this close-enough to right, with a bit
of practice.  I'd want a digital output so I can graph the temperature
curve over time, and make sure I'm hitting the right limits.  Not sure that
this is reasonably possible, but it's an interesting thought.
