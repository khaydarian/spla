With Jeanelle's help, I've put in bids on a handful of crummy but
mostly-working SNES machines, targeting used machines that are ugly (which I
don't care about), but have functional. "No sound" is great, since I don't
care about that, but other buyers likely will. The only trick here is to avoid
the SNES 1-Chip, which is apparently pretty rare anyways -- collectors like
them for the better video quality. I'll also need to get a power adapter
(which is cheap via third party, doesn't have to be authentic), and cable with
RCA plugs (which is dirt cheap, even when new).

Also, I'll need an actual game to test with. "Super Mario World" will do.
Oddly enough, I probably won't bother with controllers -- since I just need the
main menu screen.

Speaking of power adapters, there a buch of photos on Ebay of the `SNS-002` AC
adapter, which says:

*   `INPUT AC120V 60Hz 17W`
*   `OUTPUT DC10V 850mA`

That's less current than I'd expect, honestly, and there doesn't seems to be
any other model number of note. Strange.
