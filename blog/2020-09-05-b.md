Notes on games to get sample frames from:

* Super Mario World: it's familiar and easily accessible, and there's a few clever uses of the hardware (keyhole using HDMA).
* Air Strike Patrol: Uses timing-sensitive rendering in several scenes.  Notoriously hard to emulate properly.
* F1 game (which?): Has a mid-scanline rendering thing discovered recently.
* Uniracers: Uses mid-scanline writes to change sprite positions.
* Sonic the Hedgehog (SNES port): For memeability.
