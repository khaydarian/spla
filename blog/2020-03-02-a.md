My package of amazon-sourced soldering stuff arrived; everything is present,
but most things are *much* smaller than I'd realized -- which in retrospect
isn't surprising.

Also, the first SNES arrived, and appears to work as advertised: video, games
work, but no sound. The cheap knock-off controllers are just as annoying as I
expected, but I probably won't be using them much -- I'll probably use Yoshi's
house as a test pattern for the first several experiments on working hardware,
and once my board is working I can grab a test vector from and emulator easily
enough.

The third-party power supply is weirdly light; it's probably some incredibly
cheap board in there. I'll definitely use something better for the actualy
board -- third party, but not so cheap. (Actually I'll probably use a bench
power supply for a while; maybe buy a build-your-own kit.)

One oddity is that my old TV doesn't have a very good analog-to-digital
upscaler; there's ton of fringing and other ugly effects. It's an HD TV (HDMI
at least), but one old enough to have component RCA connectors still. Good
enough for now.

However, a hiccup I hadn't considered: the Super Nintendo uses some wacky security screws, so getting into the thing might end up being quite a bit harder than
I'd imagined. Easiest method to defeat this is to buy a $7 screwdriver on
Amazon. More annoying than anything else, since I've borrowed Kor's scope, but
now I can't use it tonight. Fie.
