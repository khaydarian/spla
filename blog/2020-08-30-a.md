# Board `b003` Manufacturing Testing (continued).

1.  Power Validation: Done.
1.  FTDI Bringup.
    1.  12MHz clock input, on test pad: Nominal.
    1.  12MHz clock input, on ftdi pin 2: Nominal.
    1.  USB connectivity: Nothing.
        1.  Clock shows up ok.
        1.  Reset is high, as expected.
        1.  Check for adjacent bridged pins:
        1.  Just reflow the whole chip with generous amounts of flux.
            1.  Set off smoke detector; Dog panicks; bump the chip off the pads badly.
            1.  Take a break for a bit.

Aside: Button pinout is wrong; pins are backwards from datasheet.  Oops.

1.  FTDI Bringup (again).
    1.  USB connectivity: Works!
    1.  Run `splat bringup_first`.  `ACTIVE` LED flashes.
    1.  Run `splat ftdi_new_device --write --serial "SPLA_r010_b003"
        1.  Power cycle the board.
        1.  Verify USB connectivity with correct vendor/product idn:e
    1.  Run `splat bringup_ftdi`.  Mostly ok, but sometimes complains about A-bu pins being all stuck high.  Not sure.
    1.  Run `splat bringup_fifo` to verify ADBUS fifo pins.  Nominal.
        1.  _Note: I need to add an explicit pass/fail here, which also handles the exceptions for the FPGA pins (which otherwise report as "broken")._
    1.  FTDI bringup complete.
1.  FPGA Bringup.
    1.  Run `splat bringup_fpga`.  `LED_A` / `LED_B` flash.  Pass.
    1.  Run `splat bringup_fifo`.  Pass.

Oops, forgot to fixup `default.lpf`.  Need to do that before I can go further.
