## PCB Layout

PCB Layout is pain. Nothing lines up, and all the components are weird sizes.
It's a bit easier with 0.2mm vias an 0.1mm tracks (which in theory JLCPCB can
do), and it helps if I line up the pads on the grid and make "stub" traces to
get things to behave. Not super happy with it, but it works.

Pin-mapping works best when I lay out the parts, and then set up which goes
where by marching around the FPGA. I am trapping some interior pins, though,
which I think is unavoidable with a four-layer (two-signal-layer) PCB.
Probably ok though, and I can cut out the level shifter enables if I need to.

## Analog and Power

I still haven't fixed analog; the `AD9280` only supports a 2V peak-to-peak range
(which is weird), but I'm not sure how to deal with that. Plausibly I should
set up a trivial two-layer breakout PCB for it, that's compatible with a
breadboard pitch, and use that as a first test of JLCPCB's manufacturing. Not a
bad plan, actually. It's even plausible to hook that up to the actual SNES
pins (with some very fiddly soldering), and make sure it works properly.
I'll need a bench supply for this, too.

Power is also wrong still; I'm sorely tempted to try some cheap and simple LDO
solution, but I suspect the heat dissapation is too high. Sigh.
