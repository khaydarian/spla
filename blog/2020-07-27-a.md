Finishing up level shifter bringup: Added an image to just drive a UART pattern on each of the output pins; there's only 16 output-only pins to worry about.  This works every every pin except `ppu1_hvcmode`, which seems to be a bad pin on chip U15: Sampling on the shoulders of the pins shows the signal going into the chip, but not coming out the other side.  Inconvenient.
