Lab notes: trying the "vram in steps" (`bringup_vram_steps`) approach.

States:

* 0: Address pins driven low, data bus pins floating.
* 1: Address pins driven high, data bus pins output high.
* 2: Data bus pins driven to known values (VDA = `0xa1`, VDB = `0xb2`).
* 3: Start write cycle by driving `VAWR_N = 0`, `VBWR_N` = 0`.
* 4: End write cycle by driving `VAWR_N = 1`, `VBWR_N` = 1`.
* 5: Turn around the data bus (from output to input).
* 6: Start read cycle by driving `VRD_N = 0`.

Pins sampled one a time (slowly!) via scope.

[w0] pin was at ~8mV, which is strange.

Conclusions:

* A single write-read cycle appears to work.  Might be some floating stuff involved, but it's at least reasonably close.
* Several A-side pins have issues: `VAA6`, `VAA0`, `VAA13`.  Probably not soldered properly.
* A-side VRAM chip drives `0` signals as ~8mV, rather than actually 0V.  B-side VRAM chip doesn't do this, so something's up.  Might be just chip variation, or a shorted signal somewhere.
* If I'm coordinating the various control signals properly, then the power usage stays stable, like it ought to.

One of the original problems what that I was driving all the address / data / control signals on the same clock, which isn't valid -- there's likely some setup and hold timing that I'm violating, and this give unreliable data.  Also some of the pins are not connected properly, which messes things up.
