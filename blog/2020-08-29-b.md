# Board `b003` Manufacturing Testing.

1.  Power Validation
    1.  Power LEDs are lit.
    1.  3.3V regulator measured at 3.238V (-1.8%).  Nominal.
    1.  5.0V regulator measured at 4.92V (-1.6%).  Nominal.
    1.  Enabled 1.1V and 2.5V.  Board power 20mA / 0.239W.
    1.  1.1V LDO measured at 1.099V; 2.5V LDO measured at 2.503V.  Nominal.
1.  FTDI Bringup.
    1.  Check for power/ground faults.
        1.  Ground to 3.3V: 9.36kohm.
        1.  Ground to 5.0V: 0.768kohm.  Odd.
        1.  3.3v to 5.0V: 9.35kohm.
    1.  Enabled 3.3V.  Board power 50mA / 0.600W.
        1.  _Oddity: `ACTIVE` light came on._
    1.  Verified 12MHz clock input.  Nominal.
    1.  Measured FTDI 1.8V LDO at 0.004V.  Broken.
        1.  _Also, the `ACTIVE` light flickered, so that's wrong too._
        1.  _Ok, that's a problem.  Most likely cause is that the FTDI chip isn't properly soldered down, and power isn't getting in all the right places._
        1.  Probing with scope reveals that it's a dodgy solder joing on FTDI pin 49 `VREOUT`.  Pressing down on it causes the 1.8V to appear.  Fixed with soldering iron.
        1.  Re-measured at 1.856V.  Nominal.
