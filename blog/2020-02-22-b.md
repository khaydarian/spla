Derp: The `74LVC245A` doesn't do what I'd thought it does: it's bascially a bus
switch, which can be configured to pass signals in either direction, or block
them. But, it doesn't do any level translation; it's just 3.3v to 5v tolerant,
and the outputs (in whichever direction) are driven at Vcc. No good for my
application, unless I used a ton of them in unidirectional mode maybe. Better
solutions exist.

The [SparkFun BOB-11771](https://sparkfun.com/products/11771) is based on the
TI `TXB0104`, which is *actually* a 4-bit level shifter, and has automatic
direction sensing (based on current I presume). Nate did mention that there's
some gotcha with that; I'll have to ask him again.

Relatedly, the TI `TXS0108E` is a similar 8-bit-wide part. Wider seems to be for
specialized applications. There's also the LSF0108, which is similar but just
in a different family? Not sure about this.

JLCPCB-SMT has the `TXS0108ERGYR` in stock, so let's go with that for now.

And delete the symbol I just made for the `74LVC245A`.  But, KiCad has a
`TXS0108EPW` symbol already.  Win!
