Re-reading the `FT2232H` datasheet, I notice some weirdness around suspend-mode.  Pin 60 `PWREN#` and pin 36 `SUSPEND#` are both outputs, and I've left them floating (eventually connected to the FPGA), so that's fine.  Probably useful to sample these pins, though, to see if the chip is in suspend mode.  Pin 59 `PWRSAV#` I've hooked up for `JTAG_TMS`, but that's supposedly an "EEPROM configurable option", and the default is "disabled".  Probably not the problem, but I should probe those pins to see what's up.

* Pin 60 `PWREN#` is high.  "USB Suspend mode, or not configured."
* Pin 36 `SUSPEND#` is low.  Device is in suspend mode.
* Pin 59 `PWRSAV#` / `JTAG_TMS` is pulled high, as expected.

This actually doesn't help any.
