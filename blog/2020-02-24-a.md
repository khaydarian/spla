I chatted with Nate today about power things; he suggested using two ST1S10
regulators (which he's using in some other personal project) to step-down from
12V to 5V (SNES chips) and 3.3V (everything else), and then use cheap LDOs from
3.3V to 2.5V and 1.1V for the FPGA.  SOunds reasonable, and he also sent me the
bit of schematic to compare to.

In other news: there's now sufficient known-unknowns about the SNES hardware
that I'm going to have to hook up a scope to a real working one -- and while
I'm at it, I may as well buy a few non-working ones for eventual
chip-scrounging.  This is mostly an Ebay-based operation, since there's a ton
of crappy old SNES's on there, but mostly overpriced.

I'll need to borrow a scope, though, since I don't have one (yet) -- plausibly
I can borrow Kor's over a weekend.
