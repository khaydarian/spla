Minor notes on finishing up part selection.  Most notably, the high-frequency
high-pass filters (>10MHz) need very tiny capacitors (1pF) which are basically
not available.  For the time being, I've left the schematic and footprints in
place, but `NOSTUFF`'d the actual parts.  I can add these filters if that ends
up being useful, but for now I'll ignore it.

## Part Selection - Capacitors

Start with:
* Manufacturer: Murata Electronics (cheap, but a bit arbitrary).
* Part Status: Active.
* Packaging: Cut Tape (or at least not DigiReel).
* Mounting Type: Surface Mount, MLCC

Generally speaking:
* Don't care about voltage rating, usually large enough to not matter.
* Tolerance isn't important for decoupling, but is for filters -- 5% is maybe ok.
* Prefer cheap parts with large available stock.

4.7nF is only available is 0805 package; change PCB later.

1pF isn't available at all -- possibly this high MHz filter isn't necessary.  For now, NOSTUFF this and leave it as an option for later.

Same for low-pass output filter; NOSTUFF for now.

## Part Seelction - Resistors

Start with:
* Not digireel or tape-and-reel
* Active, In Stock, Quantity 10
* Manufacturer: Stackpole Electronics (Arbitrary, but cheap).

Most ended up being from Stackpole, except for 0-ohm (which are weird).
