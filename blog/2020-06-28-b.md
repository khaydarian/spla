I belatedly figured out the `FIFO_WR_N` problem: The `FT2232H` doesn't have a "just-serial" mode; instead is has RS232 mode, which has a bunch of extra control signals.  Most of these don't matter, or only mildy disrupt the serial connection, but `FIFO_WR_N` is connected to `RXLED#`, which probably has a high-current driver enabled, which can easily overwhelm the FPGA's ability to drive that signal.  Duh.

So, I can't use `bringup_boundary` to test the FTDI connections.  Instead, I'll write a different image that just drives the pins high and low in some pattern, and read that pattern off the FTDI chip in MPSSE mode, similar to `bringup_ftdi`.  Call it `bringup_fifo` instead, I suppose.

I'm still not sure what's up with the second board, though -- probably I should try reflowing the FPGA and see if that helps.
