I'm still not sure about the weird can't-drive-low behavior of the second board's FPGA, but now it doesn't matter: I accidentally brushed the 5V rail with my signal wire, and the reverse voltage fried the chip.  The board is now absorbing 1.8W (150mA), even without the USB plugged, and 2.165W (180mA) with USB plugged in.  The chip is unresponsive to programming, and is strongly driving the D8 and `DONE` pins, which is definitly wrong.  Humourously, my error message reads: "Wrong Chip ID 0xffffffff: broken board?", which it definitely is.  Oops.

This is frusturating, not just because I've burned out a (somewhat) expensive FPGA, but also because I now can't debug the weird can't-drive-low behavior.  Sigh.

I still have one FPGA left, before I have to order more.  It's probably worth building a better script for ordering parts, though.
