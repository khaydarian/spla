There's something very suspicious about `FIFO_WR_N`: it's disconnected on both boards, which is flatly implausible.  Let's check some details:

* `FT2232H` Datasheet does say that pin 29 is the FIFO mode's `#WR` pin.
* Pin 29 (aka `ACBUS3`) is labelled as `FIFO_WR_N`.
* `FIFO_WR_N` is connected to `P12` on the FPGA.  This happens to also be `LRC_GPLLOC_IN`, but that's not remarkable; we can use it as a plain single-ended GPIO without issues.
* `P12` is listed in `default.lpf` as `fifo_wr_n`.
* In `bringup_boundary.v`, `fifo_wr_n` reports as `PINDEF_FIFO_WR_N`.
* In `lib/pindef.v`, `PINDEF_FIFO_WR_N` is 15, which isn't duplicated elsewhere.
* In `bringup_boundary.c`, `PINDEF_FIFO_WR_N` is used as expected.

This makes no sense.

If I hack `bringup_boundary.v` to drive `fifo_wr_n` in the same way as `tp9`, if *definitely* shows up on the scope -- but inconsistently at 2.8V instead of 3.3V.  That makes _even less sense_.  Looks like this drop in volatage happens a few times a second, for about 1ms. [SDS00021]

Even weirder, when I hook up the scope, I can't see the square wave on `TP9` -- but I _can_ on `FIFO_WR_N` on the FTDI chip.  Something terribly strange is going on.
