With new `bringup_levelshifter1` tool, I can test all the level-shifted inputs (and bidirectional pins) with the same technique as before.  Initial results show that everything works, except:

* `vaa{5,7,9,10,12}`
* `ppu2_tst[1]`

These were all easy to fix with some judicious soldering iron touch-up.

I still need to test the outputs, which is more tricky -- possibly I can attach a `uart_tx` to each pin, with a different bit pattern to identify.
